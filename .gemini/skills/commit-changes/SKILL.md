# Commit Changes Skill

This skill automates the workflow for committing changes in the Zia Pizza Website repository, ensuring logical grouping of related changes, consistent versioning, and accurate commit messages. It is designed for autonomous execution.

## Prerequisites

- **Git** must be installed and configured.
- **Node.js** must be available to run the `bump_version.js` script.
- **cmd /c** should be used for all shell commands on Windows.

## Workflow

### 1. Status Audit

Before analyzing changes, the agent MUST report the current state of the workspace.

1. **Check Versions**: Run the status report script to see what versions everything is currently on.
   ```bash
   cmd /c "node .gemini/skills/commit-changes/scripts/get_status.js"
   ```
2. **Report**: Display the current versions. Proceed autonomously to analyze changes without asking for confirmation or feature lists.

### 2. Analyze and Group Changes

Run `git status` and `git diff` to identify all changed files. Group these files into **logical sets** based on the objective or nature of the changes. **Maximize granularity**: create a separate group for each distinct objective.

### 3. Determine Bump Type

Decide on the bump type for this phase: `patch` (default for most changes), `major`, or `none`.

### 4. Execute Objective-Based Commits (Code Only)

For EACH logical group identified in step 2:

1. **Stage only the relevant files**: `git add path/to/file1 ...`
2. **Generate a specific commit message**:
   - **Regular Changes**: `Nature(Component): Detailed description of this specific group of changes`
   - **Fix Type**: If the change is a fix, use: `fix(Component): Description (vX.Y)` where `vX.Y` is the **current** version of the component (not the bumped one).
3. **Write the message** to a temporary file `commit_msg.txt`.
4. **Commit**: `cmd /c "git commit -F commit_msg.txt"`
5. **Cleanup**: Delete `commit_msg.txt`.

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT include version file updates (e.g., `package.json`) in these commits.

### 5. Final Version Bump Commit

After all functional changes are committed, perform a single, final commit for all version bumps.

1. **Apply Bumps**: Run `bump_version.js` for the root.
   ```bash
   cmd /c "node .gemini/skills/commit-changes/scripts/bump_version.js package.json patch true"
   ```
2. **Stage all version files**: `git add package.json`
3. **Generate commit message**: `chore(version): bump to vX.Y`
4. **Commit**: `cmd /c "git commit -m \"[message]\""`

## Guidelines

- **Autonomous Mode**: Do NOT ask the user for confirmation, approval, or additional information once the directive to commit is given.
- **Atomic Commits**: Keep commits focused. Don't mix UI changes with data layer changes in one commit.
- **Granularity**: If a component has two unrelated changes, make two separate commits.
- **Root Bump**: Ensure the root `package.json` version is updated at least once during the process if any changes occurred.
